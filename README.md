# Kaggle-Volcanic-Eruption-Prediction
This repository describe our solution to the Kaggle competition Volcanic Eruption Prediction.
Our main goal in this competition was finding a suitable and applicable model in order to predict when the next volcano eruption will occur. We used different Machine Learning methods to analyze a large geophysical dataset collected by sensors deployed on active volcanoes .
We designed  and trained a machine learning model that predicts the time of eruption , based on our explanatory variables. We wrote our code in Python using  sklearn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy, matplotlib libraries .

The repository contains 2 notebooks :
* [Data exploration.ipynb]( https://github.com/shaniklein/Volcanic-Eruption-Prediction-Kaggle-Competetion/blob/main/Data%20exploration.ipynb) - includes the Exploratory data analysis (EDA) we applied on the data
* [Training and Prediction.ipynb]( https://github.com/shaniklein/Volcanic-Eruption-Prediction-Kaggle-Competetion/blob/main/Training%20and%20Prediction.ipynb) - includes the training and evaluation of the best model we found, in addition includes code for feature selection using LASSO and PCA.

The [Project presentation]( https://github.com/shaniklein/Volcanic-Eruption-Prediction-Kaggle-Competetion/blob/main/Project%20presentation.pdf) - is the final report of our solution including including theory explanations and concrete results in the competition.
